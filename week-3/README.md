1. Connect your account to Netlify !

The first step to deploy in Netlify is creating a new account or use existing account. As a beginner progammer, I would prefer using GitHub account instead.

After you successfully login, you will be redirected to dashboard of Netlify app. In this scenario, you will need to import your existing project from github to netlify. Add new site -> Import existing project -> Connect via GitHub

2. Auto Deploy with Netlify !

One of the benefit using your GitHub account connected to Netlify is that you don't have to worry about re-deploying your project manually, once there are changes that have been pushed in your repository, it will automatically re-deployed by Netlify within second.

3. Domain Registrar with NiagaHoster
